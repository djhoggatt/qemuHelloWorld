# Bare Metal Hello World for QEMU

This is a small demo/template for bare metal projects.

It's a simple "Hello World" program that prints out Hello World to the UART port.

This is specifically written for the versatilepb QEMU board (details here: https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/arm/versatile.html).
